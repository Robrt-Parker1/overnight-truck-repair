            <h2>The Importance of a Healthy Car Battery</h2>
            <p>Your car battery provides the necessary electrical current to start the engine and power essential systems such as lights, radio, and climate control.

            <h2>Slow Engine Crank</h2>
            <p>One of the most noticeable signs of a failing battery is a slow engine crank. If you turn the key and the engine takes longer than usual to start, it could indicate a weak battery. Over time, batteries lose their ability to hold a charge, making it harder for the engine to turn over.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Dashboard Warning Light</h2>

            <p>A weak battery affects more than just the engine. It can cause dim headlights, flickering dashboard lights, and malfunctioning electronics. If your car’s electrical components are not working properly, it may be time to check the battery’s condition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Frequent Jump-Starts</h2>
            <p>If you find yourself needing to jump-start your car frequently, it is a clear sign that your battery is no longer holding a sufficient charge. Constant jump-starts put additional strain on the battery and other electrical components, making it necessary to replace the battery as soon as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Old Age of the Battery</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Unusual Smell from the Battery</h2>
